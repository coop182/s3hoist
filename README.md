The following options are available:

h | Height in px | http://www.domain.com/images/products/h_150/product10.png will output an image scaled to 150px high whilst maintaining its original aspect ratio.
mw | Max Width in px | http://www.domain.com/images/products/mw_650/product10.png will output an image without any scaling unless the image is larger than the max width specified in which case a width of 650px will be set and it will be scaled.
mh | Max Height in px | http://www.domain.com/images/products/mh_650/product10.png will output an image without any scaling unless the image is larger than the max height specified in which case a height of 650px will be set and it will be scaled.
